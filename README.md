## About the game

The Alien is a open-source multiplayer game, inspired by "Among Us" and "Mafia".

In this game, you are placed with other players in some map, and you need to use your social and investigative skills to survive.

This game doesn't have any commercial goal, it is developed just for fun and with the help of the community.

## Players (WIP)

You can download the game directly from [itch.io](https://rluders.itch.io/the-alien). It is 100% free.

## Developers

### How to run it (WIP)

This repository has 4 Godot projects:

- **Game**, this is the game as you may guess.
- **Server**, this is the game server.
- **Auth**, this is the authentication server.
- **Gateway**, this is the gateway server that connects the player with the authentication server.

In order to execute the game to test, you should open all the projects on Godot, and execute them in the following order:

1. Auth
2. Gateway
3. Sever
4. Game

The credentials to login to the game is both (username and password): **test**
